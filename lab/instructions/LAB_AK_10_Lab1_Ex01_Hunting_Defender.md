# Learning Path 10 - Lab 1 - Exercise 1 - Perform Threat Hunting with Microsoft Sentinel in the Microsoft Defender portal

## Lab scenario

![Lab overview.](../Media/SC-200-Lab_Diagrams_Mod8_L1_Ex1.png)

You're a Security Operations Analyst working at a company that implemented Microsoft Sentinel. You have received threat intelligence about a Command and Control (C2 or C&C) technique. You need to perform a hunt and watch for the threat.

>**Important:** The lab exercises for Learning Path #10 are in a *standalone* environment. If you exit the lab before completing it, you will be required to re-run the configurations again.

<!--- The log data created in the Learning Path 9 lab exercises will not be available in this lab without rerunning the following prerequisite tasks.

 **[Lab 09 Exercise 5](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/SC-200T00A-Microsoft-Security-Operations-Analyst/Instructions/Labs/LAB_AK_09_Lab1_Ex05_Attacks.html)**

**[Lab 09 Exercise 6](https://microsoftlearning.github.io/SC-200T00A-Microsoft-Security-Operations-Analyst/Instructions/Labs/LAB_AK_09_Lab1_Ex06_Perform_Attacks.html)** --->

### Estimated time to complete this lab: 45 - 60 minutes

>**Note:** The following *Prerequisite tasks* Are pre-configured for you. They are included here for your information only.

### Prerequisite task 1: Connect an On-Premises Server

In this task, you'll connect an on-premises server to your Azure subscription. Azure Arc was pre-installed on this server. The server will be used in next exercises to run simulated attacks that you will later detect and investigate in Microsoft Sentinel.

>**Important:** The next steps are done on a different machine than the one you were previously working. Look for the Virtual Machine name in the references tab.

1. Log in to **WINServer** virtual machine as Administrator with the password: **Passw0rd!** if necessary.  

As described above, Azure Arc has been pre-installed on the **WINServer** machine. You will now connect this machine to your Azure subscription.

1. On the *WINServer* machine, select the *search* icon and type **cmd**.

1. In search results right click *Command Prompt* and select **Run as administrator**.

1. In the Command Prompt window, type the following command. *Do not press enter*:

    ```cmd
    azcmagent connect -g "defender-RG" -l "EastUS" -s "Subscription ID string"
    ```

1. Replace the **Subscription ID string** with the *Subscription ID* provided by your lab hoster (*Resources tab). Make sure to keep the quotes.

1. Type **Enter** to run the command (this may take a couple minutes).

    >**Note**: If you see the *How do you want to open this?* browser selection window, select **Microsoft Edge**.

    ```

1. Select **Yes** to create a new file and copy the following PowerShell script into *c2.ps1*.

    >**Note:** Pasting into the virtual machine file might not show the full script length. Make sure the script matches  the instructions within the *c2.ps1* file.

    ```PowerShell
    param(
        [string]$Domain = "microsoft.com",
        [string]$Subdomain = "subdomain",
        [string]$Sub2domain = "sub2domain",
        [string]$Sub3domain = "sub3domain",
        [string]$QueryType = "TXT",
        [int]$C2Interval = 8,
        [int]$C2Jitter = 20,
        [int]$RunTime = 240
    )
    $RunStart = Get-Date
    $RunEnd = $RunStart.addminutes($RunTime)
    $x2 = 1
    $x3 = 1 
    Do {
        $TimeNow = Get-Date
        Resolve-DnsName -type $QueryType $Subdomain".$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999)."$Domain -QuickTimeout
        if ($x2 -eq 3 )
        {
            Resolve-DnsName -type $QueryType $Sub2domain".$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999)."$Domain -QuickTimeout
            $x2 = 1
        }
        else
        {
            $x2 = $x2 + 1
        }    
        if ($x3 -eq 7 )
        {
            Resolve-DnsName -type $QueryType $Sub3domain".$(Get-Random -Minimum 1 -Maximum 999999)."$Domain -QuickTimeout
            $x3 = 1
        }
        else
        {
            $x3 = $x3 + 1
        }
        $Jitter = ((Get-Random -Minimum -$C2Jitter -Maximum $C2Jitter) / 100 + 1) +$C2Interval
        Start-Sleep -Seconds $Jitter
    }
    Until ($TimeNow -ge $RunEnd)
    ```

1. In the Notepad menu, select **File** and then **Save**. 

1. Go back to the Command Prompt window, enter the following command and press Enter.

    >**Note:** You will see DNS resolve errors. This is expected.

    ```CommandPrompt
    Start PowerShell.exe -file c2.ps1
    ```

>**Important:** Do not close these windows. Let this PowerShell script run in the background. The command needs to generate log entries for some hours. You can proceed to the next task and next exercises while this script runs. The data created by this task will be used in the Threat Hunting lab later. This process will not create substantial amounts of data or processing.

### Task 1: Create a hunting query

    >**Note:** It may take up to 10 minutes for the job to complete.

1. Select the refresh icon near the top-left of the *Jobs* page to refresh the *Last run status*.

1. When the *Last run status* shows **Succeeded**, select the job and the job details page opens.

1. You can view the history of the job runs and other details.

1. Select the *Destination table* link for **C2ATTACKHUNT_KQL_CL**.

1. This opens the *Advanced hunting* page with the **C2ATTACKHUNT_KQL_CL** table populated in the *New query* form. If the table name has a red rippled underline, it means the table is unknown and it may take several minutes to be updated.

    >**Note:** After the table is known to *Advanced hunting*, you can modify the query as needed to refine your search.

1. Select the **Run query** button to execute the query and view the results.

1. Review the results to identify any potential C2 activity.

### Task 4: Create a hunt that combines multiple queries into a MITRE tactic
